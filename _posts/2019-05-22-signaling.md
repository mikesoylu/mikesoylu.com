We are all animals — in the quite literal sense.

We're built with circuits in us that make us do things — sometimes useless — just to signal to others that we are _special_.

Scientists observed[^1] that turtle hunting and spear fishing men, in a Meriam community in Australia, experience greater social benefits and reproductive success than shellfish foraging men.

Even though turtle hunting and spear fishing are actually less productive, measured by caloric gains per hour, than foraging for shellfish.

Since a daily catch of fish is carried home by hand is clearly visible to everyone. And turtles are served at large feasts, members of the community know which men brought them turtle meat and fish.

Signaling strength and skill results in _evolutionary_ success.

But one wonders.

What a world where we all just foraged for shellfish would be like.
